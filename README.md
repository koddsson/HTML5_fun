Fun with HTML5
=========

Me having fun with HTML5

Since Eir√≠kur hosted a brown-bag at work about the current stage of HTML5 I got really excited and wwanted to mess with it. Not sure on how to use it but I was amazed on how easy CSS3 is.

I'll add more stuff once as I learn it. Don't expect any updates but let me know if this is kewl and you would like to see more :)

Note that I've only tried this in Google Chrome and have no plans on fixing it for other browsers while I'm just messing around. I am using sass/compass but that is the extent of my cross-browser support as of yet.

You can view the results at [this pages github page](http://koddsson.github.com/HTML5_fun)

Todo list
---------
* ~~Add keyboard bindings (also vim bindings ;)~~
* Comment code and explain how all of this adds up for the newbies
* Explain why this is so cool
