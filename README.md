Fun with HTML5

Me having fun with HTML5

Since Eir√≠kur hosted a brown-bag at work about the current stage of HTML5 I got really excited and wwanted to mess with it. Not sure on how to use it but I was amazed on how easy CSS3 is.

I'll add more stuff once as I learn it. Don't expect any updates but let me know if this is kewl and you would like to see more :)
